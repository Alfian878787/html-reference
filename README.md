# About this repo

The contents of this repo are build tools for generating the
document “HTML5: The Markup Language Reference” (or “htmlr”), a
reference meant to accompany the HTML5 spec (you can also think of
it as a sort of alternative “front end” to the HTML5 spec.

Attempting to use this build process to generate your own copy of
htmlr is not an exercise recommended for the faint of heart or
for those who lack patience or frustrated easily. It makes use of
a few old-school utilities, a few quite ugly hacks, and, worst of
all, some stuff (e.g., XSLT) which, if you’re a truly cutting-edge
hipster-developer, you may find downright distasteful.

Anyway, you can’t say I didn’t warn you.
