# About this repo

The contents of this repo are build tools for generating the document
[HTML5: The Markup Language Reference](http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/)
(or “htmlr”), a reference meant to accompany the
[HTML5 spec](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-author-view/)
(you can also think of htmlr as a sort of alternative “front end”
to the HTML5 spec…).

Attempting to use this build system on your own to generate a copy
of htmlr is not an exercise recommended for:

* the faint of heart
* those who lack patience
* those who are frustrated easily

The build system makes use of a few old-school utilities that you
may have to install or compile from sources or what not, as well
as a Makefile with more than few quite ugly hacks and GNUisms and
such that may not work on non-GNU/Linux or BSD systems—and, worst
of all some stuff (e.g., XSLT) which, if you’re a truly
cutting-edge hipster-developer, you may find downright icky.

Anyway, you can’t say I didn’t warn you.
