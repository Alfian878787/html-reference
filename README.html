<h1>About this repo</h1>

<p>The contents of this repo are build tools for generating the document
<a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/">HTML5: The Markup Language Reference</a>
(or “htmlr”), a reference meant to accompany the
<a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-author-view/">HTML5 spec</a>
(you can also think of htmlr as a sort of alternative “front end”
to the HTML5 spec…).</p>

<p>Attempting to use this build system on your own to generate a copy
of htmlr is not an exercise recommended for:</p>

<ul>
<li>the faint of heart</li>
<li>those who lack patience</li>
<li>those who are frustrated easily</li>
</ul>

<p>The build system makes use of a few old-school utilities that you may
have to install or compile from sources or what not, as well as a Makefile
with more than few quite ugly hacks and GNUisms and such that may not work
on non-GNU/Linux or BSD systems—and, worst of all some stuff (e.g., XSLT)
which, if you’re a truly cutting-edge hipster-developer, you may find
downright icky.</p>

<p>Anyway, you can’t say I didn’t warn you.</p>
